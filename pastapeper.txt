Ingredients:
350 g spaghetti 12 oz
220 g Pecorino Romano 2 cups
14 g whole black peppercorns 2 tablespoons
1 ¾ liters water - 7 ½ cups
½ tablespoon salt coarse

Instructions:
Grate the Pecorino Romano. When ready, set aside in a bowl.
Then grind the black peppercorns. For this you can use a pestle, a meat pounder or a pepper grinder adjusted so that it doesn't grind too finely. The black pepper should not be a powder.
Toast the ground pepper in a large skillet over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes.
Boil the water with very little coarse salt (maximum ½ tablespoon) to cook the pasta.
When the water boils, put in the spaghetti. Let the pasta cook for about 5 minutes.
Add 1 cup of pasta cooking water to the toasted black pepper and turn the heat under the skillet to low.
After the first 5 minutes of cooking, now is the time to transfer the pasta from the pot to the skillet.
Check the cooking time on the spaghetti package. Add another ½ cup of pasta water if needed and stir to get even cooking.
Pour 1 cup of the starchy cooking water over the grated pecorino cheese and stir quickly. You'll get a creamy consistency similar to ricotta.
Once the spaghetti are cooked, turn off the heat, wait about half a minute and then add the pecorino cream a little at a time. Stir in the spaghetti evenly. Spaghetti cacio e pepe recipe is ready!
