Ingredients:
350 g spaghetti ¾ pound
2 cloves garlic
2 chili peppers fresh or dried
6 tablespoons olive oil extra virgin
parsley a handful, chopped and fresh (optional)

Instructions:
In a large pot, bring plenty of water to a boil. When it boils, add the coarse salt. Then add the pasta and cook the spaghetti, stirring occasionally. Follow the cooking time indicated on the package (usually 8 to 12 minutes).
While the pasta is cooking, clean the garlic cloves. Cut them in half and remove the inner part. Finally cut the cloves into slices.
Then take the red chilies and cut them into thin slices. If you don't want too spicy a flavor, cut them lengthwise and remove the seeds. Then slice them finely.
Heat 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan. Add sliced garlic and sauté for about 2 minutes. Be careful that it doesn't burn. Burnt garlic gives the dish a bitter taste that is very strong. Add the chili pepper and sauté for about 3 minutes.
Cook the pasta al dente. When ready, drain the pasta. Transfer to the frying pan with the garlic and red hot chili.
Stir and sauté the spaghetti in the pan for 1 minute so that they can absorb the flavors of the aglio olio sauce. Serve pasta aglio e olio really hot with a sprinkling of finely chopped fresh parsley.
