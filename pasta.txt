Penne all'Arrabbiata (Italian Spicy Tomato Pasta)

recipe:
350 g (12 0z) of Penne rigate pasta
1 clove of garlic 
400 g (~1 pound) of fresh tomato pulp or canned San Marzano tomatoes
2 or 3 fresh red hot chilli peppers or dried red hot chili pepper
4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 
2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley 
salt, to taste
Grated Pecorino Romano, to taste (optional)

instructions:
Step 1) - If using fresh tomatoes, blanch them in boiling water for 2–3 minutes, then peel off the skin.
If using canned peeled tomatoes, drain off any excess liquid, then chop them or mash them with a fork.
Step 2) - Peel the garlic clove and slightly crush it. Finely chop the chili pepper. Chop the fresh parsley either by hand or with an electric chopper and set it aside.
Step 3) - Heat some olive oil in a frying pan over low heat. Add the garlic and chili and sauté for 2–3 minutes, being careful not to let the garlic burn—it can turn bitter and ruin the sauce.
Step 4) - Add the tomatoes to the pan and season with salt. Let the sauce simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes. Before serving, remove the garlic.
Step 5) - Meanwhile, cook the penne in salted boiling water according to the package instructions (usually about 12 minutes). Drain when al dente.
Step 6) - Add the drained pasta to the arrabbiata sauce and stir well. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and, if desired, top with grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Serve immediately.
